TO DISCUSS:
===========

How do shields work as a bonus to armour?

What's happening about money?



Add perk stat adjustments to armour and ward - look into item bonuses

Amend titles in perk char stat dropdown - ward not armour for mind.

Add current ammo to ranged weapons - only show if owned.

Add confirm to delete item button.

Improve links between item and action - fixed key required.


Improve inventory layout - Add means to organise/sort inventory and make folders.

Make roll list filter better - use NPC flag



Make XP field editable short term




Fix issue with 6 wounds/insanties - adjust row heights to fill via flex?





Get expanded list of insanities.

Weapon and armour output to tables duplicates the code to concatinate the selected traits for things like keywords.


Create a more reliable mechanism to link weapon combo actions to the selections in the weapon, as IDs seem to change when imported from a pack?

De-duplicate the health/instanity event handlers.

Create burn soul popup.

Make heal/couch inactive and grey until parent active.

Look into token animation to enable things like extending the ship gunz.



Items and perks could both add to a roll.

Make "NPC" turrets as some sort of actor.

Add dying wound box somehow tbc.

Create code to auto-import compendium content into fresh worlds, see code example at the end of: https://foundryvtt.com/article/compendium/

Create "special item" item type with effects as per perks for stuff like magic items.

Player choosen custom refinements - not needed for now, perks can be used.

Add weak mind/body perks that reduce soak ability but grant extra soul/XP.

Create perks to map to all existing expertise, perks and quirks.



BUGS
======

//Adding an item when you're a player seems to cause some sort of spaz out.

//Wounds can't be reset below 1

//Update armour > coverage to armour > protection

Stats to add:
=============

Characters

- Action points
- Resilience

Weapons
- Weapon damage
- Armour penetration

Armour
- Coverage
- Resilience


Outstanding questions:
======================

- Resolving sequence within a turn
- Ranged combat
- Number of dodges/parries/blocks
- Wound conditions - do these have stats e.g. "broken arm, -2 to actions"
