/**
 * An ActorComponent is just a proxy for an existing data store.
 * It doesn't store any real data, just the references to the data store,
 * however it should contain all the modification and utility functions, you might need.
 * Think of it as a cross between an Entity class and a Repository class in Domain Driven Design, (which is a bit like an Object Orientated DAO, or an ORM)
 *
 * This allows us to have clean separation of logical model and physical data store, the data store being a horrible mess.
 * It should also make migration between versions a bit more manageable.
 *
 * @example <caption>I want to get the maximum of the the psyche</caption>
 * this.actor.stats.health.psyche.max
 * @example <caption>I want to get the current value.</caption>
 * this.actor.stats.health.psyche.value
 * @example <caption>I want to set the current value.</caption>
 * this.actor.stats.health.psyche.value = 5
 * @example <caption>or, there is a shortcut.</caption>
 * this.actor.stats.health.psyche = 5
