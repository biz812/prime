To run a backup run:

zip -r /home/ubuntu/backups/foundry_FOO.zip /home/ubuntu/.local/share/FoundryVTT/Data/worlds/*

Where FOO is replaced with distinct filename.

To upload to S3, run:

/usr/local/bin/aws s3 cp /home/ubuntu/backups/foundry_FOO.zip s3://mh-foundry/Backups/foundry_FOO.zip

Again, replacing FOO with relevant filename.
